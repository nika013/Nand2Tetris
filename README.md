## Description

[Nand2Tetris](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) is a renowned online course that introduces students to computer architecture and low-level programming. The course takes learners on an exciting journey, starting from the very basics of building logic gates, and ultimately guiding them to construct a fully functional computer system (the Hack computer), complete with an assembler and virtual machine (VM) translator.

This repository contains my personal solutions to the main and significant assignments of the Nand2Tetris course. It showcases my understanding and implementation of various components of the Hack computer, including the compiler, VM translator, assembler, and more.

## Assignments

The repository includes solutions to the following key assignments:

1. **Logic Gates:** Implementation of basic logic gates such as AND, OR, NOT, etc., using the Hardware Description Language (HDL).

2. **Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU):** Design and implementation of the ALU capable of performing arithmetic and logical operations.

3. **Sequential Chips:** Creation of sequential logic chips, including flip-flops and registers.

4. **Memory Units:** Implementation of various memory units, such as RAM and ROM.

5. **Machine Language Programming:** Writing programs in the Hack machine language.

6. **Assembler:** Development of an assembler to convert Hack assembly code into machine code.

7. **Virtual Machine Translator:** Construction of a VM translator capable of translating VM code into Hack assembly code.

8. **High-Level Language Compilation:** Building a compiler that translates high-level language (Jack) code into VM code.

## How to Use the Solutions
To use the solutions in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

2. Navigate to the specific assignment directory you want to explore.

3. Review the source code and any additional documentation provided to understand the implementation.

4. For running compiler, vm_translator or assembler write this command in terminal for more information ```shell
python -m n2t --help
